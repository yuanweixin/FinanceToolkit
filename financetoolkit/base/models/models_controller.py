        Perform a Dupont analysis to breakdown the return on equity (ROE) into its components.

        The Dupont analysis is a method used to dissect and understand the factors that drive a company's
        return on equity (ROE). It breaks down the ROE into three key components: Profit Margin, Asset
        Turnover, and Financial Leverage.

        The formula is as follows:

            - Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue
            - Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets
            - Financial Leverage = Average Total Assets / Average Total Equity

        Notes:
            - The Profit Margin is the ratio of Net Income to Total Revenue, indicating the percentage of
            revenue that translates into profit.
            - Asset Turnover measures the efficiency of a company's use of its assets to generate sales
            revenue.

        The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is a financial metric used to estimate
        the cost of capital for a company. It represents the average rate of return a company
        must pay to its investors for using their capital. WACC takes into account the cost of
        both equity and debt, weighted by their respective proportions in the company's capital structure.

        The formula is as follows:

            - Market Value of Equity = Share Price * Total Shares Outstanding
            - Market Value of Debt = Total Debt
            - Total Market Value = Market Value of Equity + Market Value of Debt
            - Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + Beta * (Benchmark Return - Risk Free Rate)
            - Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt
            - WACC = (Market Value of Equity / Total Market Value) * Cost of Equity +
            (Market Value of Debt / Total Market Value) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Corporate Tax Rate)

        Cost of Equity (Re): The cost of equity represents the return required by the company's shareholders or
        equity investors. It is the cost of raising funds by selling equity (such as common stock). The cost
        of equity is often estimated using methods like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) or
        the Dividend Discount Model (DDM).

        Cost of Debt (Rd): The cost of debt is the interest rate the company pays on its outstanding debt.
        It is the cost of raising funds through borrowing, such as issuing bonds or taking loans.
        The cost of debt is typically based on the prevailing interest rates in the market and the
        company's creditworthiness.

        Corporate Tax Rate (Tc): The corporate tax rate is the percentage of a company's profits that
        is paid in taxes. It is used to calculate the tax shield on interest payments. Interest expenses
        on debt reduce taxable income, and the tax shield represents the tax savings resulting from these deductions.

        Market Value of Equity (E): The market value of equity is the total value of the company's outstanding
        shares of common stock. It is calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the number of shares
        outstanding.

        Market Value of Debt (D): The market value of debt is the total value of the company's outstanding
        debt obligations, such as bonds and loans. It represents the current market price of the debt instruments.

        Total Market Value of Capital (V): The total market value of capital is the sum of the market value of
        equity and the market value of debt (V = E + D). It represents the total value of the company's financing,
        both through equity and debt.

        Args:
            show_full_results (bool, optional): Whether to show the full results or just the WACC values.
            Defaults to True.
            diluted (bool, optional): Whether to use diluted shares in the calculation. Defaults to True.
            rounding (int, optional): The number of decimals to round the results to. Defaults to 4.
            growth (bool, optional): Whether to calculate the growth of the values. Defaults to False.
            lag (int | str, optional): The lag to use for the growth calculation. Defaults to 1.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: DataFrame containing Dupont analysis results, including Profit Margin, Asset
                          Turnover, Financial Leverage, and the calculated ROE values.

        Notes:
        - The Cost of Equity is approximated with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
        - The Market Value of Debt is approximated as the Total Debt.

        Intrinsic value is a fundamental concept in finance and investing that represents the
        true worth or value of an asset, security, or investment, independent of its current
        market price or prevailing market sentiment. It is a concept often associated with
        the value investing philosophy, made famous by legendary investors like Benjamin Graham
        and Warren Buffett. Understanding intrinsic value is crucial for investors looking to make
        informed decisions about where to allocate their capital.

        This functionality uses DCF, or Discounted Cash Flow which is a widely used financial
        valuation method that allows investors and analysts to estimate the intrinsic value of
        an investment or business based on its expected future cash flows. It is a fundamental
        tool in finance and investment analysis, providing a systematic way to assess the
        present value of future cash flows while considering the time value of money.

        The formula is as follows:

            - Cash Flow Projection_t = Cash Flow_t-1 * (1 + Growth Rate)
            - Terminal Value = Last Cash Flow Projection * (1 + Perpetual Growth Rate) /
            (Weighted Average Cost of Capital - Perpetual Growth Rate)
            - Enterprise Value = Sum of Present Value of Cash Flow Projections + Terminal Value
            - Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash and Cash Equivalents
            - Intrinsic Value = Equity Value / Total Shares Outstanding

        Args:
            growth_rate (float, list or dict): The growth rate to use for the cash flow projections. Can be one number
            to use for all tickers, or a list or dict that contains a growth rate for each ticker.
            perpetual_growth_rate (float, list or dict): The perpetual growth rate to use for the terminal value.
            Can be one number to use for all tickers, or a list or dict that contains a perpetual growth rate for
            each ticker.
            weighted_average_cost_of_capital (float, list or dict): The weighted average cost of capital to use for
            the terminal value. Can be one number to use for all tickers, or a list or dict that contains a
            weighted average cost of capital for each ticker.
            periods (int, optional): The number of periods to use for the cash flow projections. Defaults to 5.
            cash_flow_type (str, optional): The type of cash flow to use for the cash flow projections.
            Defaults to FREE_CASH_FLOW. Other options are OPERATING_CASH_FLOW, CHANGE_IN_WORKING_CAPITAL,
            and CAPITAL_EXPENDITURE.
            rounding (int, optional): The number of decimals to round the results to. Defaults to 4.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: DataFrame containing the intrinsic value for each ticker.

        Notes:
        - The results are highly dependent on the input. Therefore, think carefully about each input parameter to
        ensure the results are accurate (given your beliefs)
